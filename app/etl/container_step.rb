# An interesting step.  Takes as input an array of steps.  When this step runs, it passes each row through
# all of the steps in the array, in order, with the final step's output being the output of this step
#
# Why is this useful?  Rodimus runs each step in its own process, so we have overhead serializing and deeserializing 
# each row through msgpack.  msgpack is fast, but it can't work miracles.  All steps inside this container step
# run sequentially, in a single thread in a single process, so there is practically no overhead.  Use this 
# to combine multiple simple steps like filters or parsers for whcih there is no computational benefit so spinning
# up another process for each one.
